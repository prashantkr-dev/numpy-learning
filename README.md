# NumPy Learning Repository
This repository documents my structured learning of **NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical and scientific computing.  
It contains practice scripts, examples, and notes covering core NumPy concepts, with an emphasis on clarity, correctness, and applications relevant to scientific computing.

The goal of this repository is twofold:
- To build a strong conceptual and practical foundation in NumPy
- To maintain a transparent, version-controlled learning log

NumPy is a core dependency for most scientific Python libraries, including **SciPy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.  
As a first-year BS–MS student with interests in scientific computing and computational research, mastering NumPy is essential for future coursework, research projects, and data-driven problem solving.
